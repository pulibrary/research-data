"6775868","Introduction to protocols.io and the Art of Writing Protocols","Research papers and protocol organization in labs often lack detailed instructions for repeating experiments. Protocols.io is an open-access platform for researchers to collaboratively create step-by-step, interactive and dynamic protocols that can be run on mobile or web. Researchers can share protocols with colleagues, collaborators, the scientific community, or make them public, with ease and efficiency. Real-time communication and interaction keeps protocols up-to-date with versioning, forking/copying, Q&A, and troubleshooting. Public protocols receive a DOI and allow open communication with authors and researchers to encourage efficient experimentation and reproducibility. Join this webinar to learn more about protocols.io and the benefits that come with your Princeton premium account.

This workshop will have four parts:


	Introduction to protocols.io: Learn more about protocols.io's mission, how to discover public protocols, create your own protocols, share methods with others, and how to publish protocols.
	protocols.io Premium: We will walk you through how you can set up your premium account and we will start working on getting your own protocols up on protocols.io.
	The Art of Writing Protocols: Receive practical tips on how you can make your methods more reproducible and you will be equipped with a list of best practices for writing protocols.
	Protocol Importing: Please feel free to bring any protocols that you can start working on at the end of the workshop! We will stay online to answer any questions you have while you start to use protocols.io.


This is a virtual workshop presented by Emma Ganley, Director of Strategic Initiatives at protocols.io, and sponsored by the Princeton Research Data Service and the Princeton University Library. The link will be sent out to registrants in a follow-up email.
